- Project Number Two - Game for Kids Learning

- Projet Idea - Memory Card Game:
As kids grow up and head towards school age, the importance of learning through playing increases. Through games and playing, children can nurture their imagination, improve their ability to listen, as well as develop important cognitive skills that will aid their future development. And memory games are a vital part of this.

So, We made a simple memory card game for kids to play with counter of how many times they make a wrong try and a Timer to make them solve the game in short amount of time to get the whole value from the game.
